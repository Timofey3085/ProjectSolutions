"""
We need a function that receives two arguments, a value val , and the exponent of the power,  pow_ ,
and outputs the value that we want to find.
Let'see some cases:
(12385, 3) ==> 13824
(1245678, 5) ==> 1419857
The value, val will be always a positive integer.
The power, pow_ , always higher than 1 .
